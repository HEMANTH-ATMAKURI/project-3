# DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED : 
As part of my internship at CodTech IT Solutions under the Full Stack Web Development domain, I developed a Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor that enables multiple users to edit and collaborate on the same document simultaneously. The application features a dynamic and responsive user interface built using modern frontend frameworks like React.js, ensuring a seamless and interactive user experience across various devices. For the backend, I used Node.js along with Socket.IO to enable real-time, bidirectional communication between connected users. The system handles multiple concurrent editors by broadcasting changes instantly and maintaining document synchronization across all sessions. MongoDB was used as the database for persistent document storage, enabling version control and real-time updates. The collaborative editor includes features such as live typing indicators, user presence awareness, and auto-save functionality. This project challenged me to manage concurrency, handle real-time events efficiently, and maintain consistent data across clients. Through this experience, I gained hands-on knowledge of working with WebSockets, state management in collaborative environments, and designing scalable, full-stack applications using modern development tools. The project exemplifies the integration of real-time functionality, responsive UI, and robust backend architectureâ€”delivering a practical and production-ready solution for collaborative editing.
